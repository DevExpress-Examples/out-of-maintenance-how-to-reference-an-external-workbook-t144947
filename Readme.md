# How to reference an external workbook


This example demonstrates how to insert an external reference link from a workbook to another workbook. <br />An external workbook is created at runtime. Note that use of this methodÂ in production code requires a license to the DevExpress Document Server or the DevExpress Universal Subscription and a reference to the DevExpress.Docs.vX.Y.dll assembly. You can use a workbook loaded into another SpreadsheetControl instead (theÂ <strong>SpreadsheetControl.Document</strong> property).<br />The external workbook is populated with random data by importing a data table at runtime.<br />Subsequently the workbook is added to theÂ <a href="http://help.devexpress.com/#CoreLibraries/clsDevExpressSpreadsheetExternalWorkbookCollectiontopic">ExternalWorkbookCollection</a>. <br />A cell formula in the current worksheet can reference a workbook contained in that collection.<br /><br />See also theÂ <a href="http://help.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/CustomDocument12272">Cell Referencing</a>Â documentation topic available online.<br /><br />
